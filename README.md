# My-projects

In this folder you can see two of my projects. A brief description of the projects is given below.

The first project is called "Research of advertisements for the sale of apartments". 
We have at our disposal the data of the Yandex Real Estate service - an archive of ads for several years about the sale of apartments in St. Petersburg and neighboring settlements. The task is to perform data preprocessing and study them in order to find interesting features and dependencies that exist in the real estate market.

The second one is called "Research of new payment mechanics in online school".
During testing of one hypothesis, the target group was offered a new mechanism for paying for services on the site, while the control group remained with the basic mechanics. As a task, it is necessary to analyze the results of the experiment and draw a conclusion whether it is worth launching a new payment mechanism for all users.
